        <p>This app shows how to connect to an Arduino BLE shield. Note that you must run this app in the EvoThings client app, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. Device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher required.</p>
        <p>How to use: The input from analog pin A4 is plotted on the canvas. Example setup used is 5V+ to variable resistor with output in parallel to ~3K-resistor connected to ground and a direct wire to A4.</p>
        <p>There are known problems with BLE stop working on multiple reloads. Restart the EvoThings client app in this case.</p>
