		<p>This app charts magnetometer data from the Texas Instruments SensorTag. Note that you must run this app in the EvoThings client app, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. Device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher required.</p>
		<p>How to use: Activate the SensorTag, if everything works the tag is discovered and data is plotted to the canvas. There are known problems with BLE stop working on multiple reloads. Restart the EvoThings client app in this case.</p>
