		<p>This app charts magnetometer data from the Texas Instruments SensorTag. Note that you must run this app in the Evothings Client app, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. A device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3+ or iOS 7+ is required.</p>

		<p><b>How to use:</b> Activate the SensorTag and tap the Connect button. If everything works the tag is discovered and magnetometer data is plotted to the canvas. Move your SensorTag close to a magnet to see the plot change. For example, move it close to your laptop or mobile phone which often contain sources of magnetism, or go fetch a fridge magnet from your kitchen and use that.</p>

		<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b>On Android, there are known problems with that BLE stops working when switching between apps or doing multiple reloads. In this case restart the Evothings Client app. Additionally, you can use the Evothings Workbench Tools to see any error messages that may help in your investigation.</p>
